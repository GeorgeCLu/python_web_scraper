# python_web_scraper

This was a project created for submission for the 2019 Microsoft Student Accelerator program.

The jupyter notebook contains a web scraper that uses python and BeautifulSoup to extract all car listings and their data that were offered for sale on Autotrader at the time.

As the full notebook is too large to display on github, another notebook "car sales data scraper first page data only.ipynb" which only scraped listings from the first page of Autotrader may be viewed.

This data was then put into PowerBi to create data visulisations which are contained in the pbix, ppt and pdf files.
