# python_web_scraper

This was a project created for submission for the 2019 Microsoft Student Accelerator program, and was entirely for educational purposes only.

This involved web scraping data from a site and visualising the data on PowerBI and presenting this in person to the Microsft Student Partners.

The jupyter notebook contains a web scraper that uses python and BeautifulSoup to extract 15,000 car listings and their data that were offered for sale on Autotrader at the time into a csv file "output-test-15000.csv".

As the full notebook is too large to display on github, another notebook "car sales data scraper first page data only.ipynb" which only scraped listings from the first page of Autotrader is included to be viewed.

This data was then put into PowerBi to create data visulisations which are contained in the otherwise identical pbix, ppt and pdf files.

The presentation slides contain further visualisation of data and trends of the listings, such as price vs mileage.
